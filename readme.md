# Amazon Fashion Recommendation Engine using Django3
> Recommendation of fashion clothes using TFIDF, BOW and CNN. In tfidf and bow I have taken the euclidean distance between the brand name, color, price of query image and all the reamaining images. In CNN based model I have extracted all the features using VGG16 architecture and get the euclidean distance between query image and all the images.
